__Maze Solver: Project Outline__

Will probably use a combination of Spiral/AGILE development

*- Determine tools for visual representation*

*- Consider approaches for foundation to scale project*

*- Develop Maze Generation*

*- Use basic BFS algorithm*

*- First Proto-type should solve a simple maze*

*- Implement advanced algorithms (A`*` and/or Dijkstra) w/ single maze*

*- Determine best approach for simultaneous visualization*

Foundation (Prototype) -> Visual Enhancement (Tkinter) -> Expand algorithms -> Enhance (stats) -> Document
